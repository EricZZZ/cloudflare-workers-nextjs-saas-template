Welcome to our built-in blog system! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to start using our powerful and flexible blogging platform.

1. Navigate to the `content/blog` directory in your project
2. Create a new folder with the language code (e.g., `en` for English)
3. Create an MDX file with your content
4. Add frontmatter metadata at the top of your file

## Blog Features

### Table of Contents

Our blog automatically generates a table of contents for posts with multiple headings. This makes it easy for readers to navigate through longer articles.

### Back to Top Button

For longer articles, we provide a convenient "Back to Top" button that appears when you scroll down the page, allowing you to quickly return to the top.

### Responsive Design

The blog system is fully responsive and works great on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

## Multilingual Support

Our blog system supports multiple languages out of the box:

- English (`en`)
- Chinese (`zh`)
- Japanese (`ja`)

To create content in different languages, simply place your MDX files in the corresponding language folder under `content/blog`.

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive titles and meta descriptions
2. Include relevant tags for better organization
3. Add images to make your posts more engaging
4. Use heading hierarchy properly (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
5. Keep paragraphs short and readable

## Conclusion

Our blog system is designed to be powerful yet simple to use. With features like automatic table of contents, multilingual support, and responsive design, it provides everything you need to create and maintain a professional blog.
